Title: "Craft Beer:Alcohol Content and Bitterness Preference Analysis
Authors: "Michael Catalano + Hayley Horn"
Date: "October 20, 2018"
Due: Thursday, October 18th 2018 One hour before live session. 

Purpose
    This analysis focuses craft beer data, analysing the data on two measurements of beer composition, and some geographic details. The first measurement is Alcohol By Volume (ABV) which is a percentage that represents how much of a beer is alcohol versus other ingredients. The other measurement we will consider is International Bitterness Units (IBU) which is measured on a scale of 0 to 100 and describes the bitterness from hops in a beer.Â
