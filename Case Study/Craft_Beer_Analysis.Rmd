Beer can be made using a range of ingredient to adjust the color, type and flavor profile. This analysis focuses on 2 measurements of beer composition, and some geographic details. The first measurement is Alcohol By Volume (ABV) which is a percentage that represents how much of a beer is alcohol versus other ingredients. The other measurment we will consider is International Business Units (IBU) whichis measured on a scale of 0 to 100 and describes the bitterness from hops in a beer. By law in the United States, the ABV must be listed on each beer to give customers an idea about how much alcohol is in each brew. 

For this analysis, we have taken data 2410 craft beers and sales data from 558 US breweries to identify trends or regionality for preference. We use craft brewery data versus national brands as there is more product experimentation and product churn.

<br><span style="color:blue"><b>In Summary</b></span>

There was not evidence of a relationship between the ABV and IBU. The state of Maine had the highest IBU content and there was a tie for alcohol content between the the District of Columbia and the state of Kentucky.

For further analysis, we recommend applying demographic information to the analysis to determine if different generational segments have preferences, and regionality of preference with the target generational segments.
